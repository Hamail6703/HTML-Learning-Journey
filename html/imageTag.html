    utilizes the src attribute for image url
    alt attribute for alternative text(if the image isn't loaded)
    can be resized using width and height (set one thing at a time, not both together)
    Self-closing, doesn't require an end tag-->

    we can take a link from internet and put it as source, so it will getch that image from the internet-->
